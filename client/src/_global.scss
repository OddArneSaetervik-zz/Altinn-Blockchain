/*
  This is a partial Scss file and it should contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Scss files.
  This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain.
  A partial is simply a Scss file named with a leading underscore.
  The underscore lets Scss know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file.
  Scss partials are used with the @import directive. More info: http://sass-lang.com/guide

  Example:
  ---- this partial ----
  $font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;
  $primary-color: #333;

  @mixin border-radius($radius) {
    -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
       -moz-border-radius: $radius;
        -ms-border-radius: $radius;
            border-radius: $radius;
  }

  ---- a different Scss file ----
  @import "global";

  .box {
    font-family: $font-stack;
    color: $primary-color;
    @include border-radius(10px);
   }
